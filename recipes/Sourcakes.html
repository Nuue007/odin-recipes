    If you’ve been nurturing a sourdough 
    starter for a while, you’ve probably 
    either amassed or thrown away a lot of it. 
    Making pancakes is one of the most common 
    ways to get rid of excess starter (also known as discard)

<h1>Method and steps</h1>
<br>
<h3><li>Combine the dry ingredients:</li></h3>
<p>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>
<h3><li>Separate the eggs.</li></h3>

<h3><li>Combine the wet ingredients:</li></h3>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 1/4 cups milk with the sourdough starter, egg yolks, vanilla extract, and melted butter until no traces of sourdough or egg remain.</p>
<h3><li>Make the batter:</li></h3>
<p>Using a rubber spatula fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until only a few traces of dry flour remain. (It’s okay if your batter is a little lumpy). The batter will be slightly thinner than typical pancake batter but not too much so that it was runny. Set aside.</p>
<h3><li>Whisk the egg whites:</li></h3>
<p>Using a whisk or a hand mixer whip the egg whites together until the soft peaks form. When you turn your whisk upside down, the peaks of your egg whites should just start to hold. Switch to a spatula and gently fold in 1/3 of the egg whites into the batter until few streaks remain.

    Fold the remaining whites into the batter, being careful not to knock the air out of the whites by folding too aggressively.
    </p>
<h3><li>Preheat your oven:</li></h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 170°F (or the warm setting if your oven has one.) Place a wire rack on a large sheet pan and put it in the oven as you cook your pancakes.</p>
<h3><li> Cook the pancakes:</li></h3>
<p>In a large non-stick skillet over medium low heat, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil.

    Pour about 1/4 cup of batter per pancake into your preheated pan and cook for 2 minutes or until the edges begin to dry out, take a peek at the bottom and flip once it has browned. </p>
